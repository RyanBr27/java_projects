## 1. Body Mass Index Calculator

- Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of health that is based on a person’s weight and height. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of a person’s height (in meters).
- This program prompts the user to enter a weight (in pounds) and a height (in inches) and then displays the BMI. Note that one pound is 0.45359237 kilograms and one inch is 0.0254 meters.


## 2. Calendar Generator

- A simple program that prompts the user to specify a year (e.g., 2022) and then displays a calendar for each month in that year using the Zeller's getStartDay() method.
- The method getStartDay() implements Zeller's Algorithm for determining the day of the week the first day of a month is. The method adjusts Zeller's numbering scheme for day of week ( 0=Saturday, ..., 6=Friday ) to conform to a day of week number that corresponds to ISO conventions (i.e., 1=Monday, ..., 7=Sunday).
